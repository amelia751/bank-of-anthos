EFFECTIVE DATE: {datetime.now().strftime('%B %d, %Y')}

This Credit Card Agreement ("Agreement") is between you and Bank of Anthos ("Bank," "we," "us," or "our"). By using your Bank of Anthos credit card, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

SECTION 1: ACCOUNT TERMS
Your Bank of Anthos credit card account is subject to the following terms:

Annual Percentage Rate (APR): {terms.get('apr_rate', 18.99)}% for purchases and balance transfers
Credit Limit: ${terms.get('credit_limit', 15000):,}
Annual Fee: ${terms.get('annual_fee', 0)} (charged to your account annually)
Grace Period: {terms.get('grace_period_days', 25)} days from the statement closing date
Late Payment Fee: ${terms.get('late_fee', 25)}
Cash Advance APR: {terms.get('cash_advance_apr', 24.99)}%
Cash Advance Fee: {terms.get('cash_advance_fee', '5% or $10 minimum')}
Balance Transfer Fee: {terms.get('balance_transfer_fee', '3% or $5 minimum')}
Foreign Transaction Fee: {terms.get('foreign_transaction_fee', 2.7)}%

SECTION 2: PAYMENT TERMS
Your minimum payment will be the greater of $25 or 2% of your total balance, plus any past due amounts and fees. Payments are due by 5:00 PM ET on the due date shown on your statement.

If you pay the total new balance shown on your monthly statement by the due date, you will not be charged interest on new purchases during the grace period.

SECTION 3: INTEREST CALCULATION
We calculate interest using the Average Daily Balance method (including new purchases). Interest begins accruing on cash advances and balance transfers from the transaction date.

The Daily Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing the APR by 365. Interest charges are calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the Daily Periodic Rate and the number of days in the billing cycle.

SECTION 4: FEES AND CHARGES
In addition to interest charges, you may be charged the following fees:
- Late Payment Fee: ${terms.get('late_fee', 25)} if payment is received after the due date
- Over-Limit Fee: $0 (we do not charge over-limit fees)
- Returned Payment Fee: $35 if your payment is returned unpaid
- Card Replacement Fee: $25 for expedited card replacement
- Foreign Transaction Fee: {terms.get('foreign_transaction_fee', 2.7)}% of each transaction in foreign currency

SECTION 5: DEFAULT AND PENALTY TERMS
You will be in default if you:
- Fail to make a minimum payment by the due date
- Exceed your credit limit by more than $200 for more than one billing cycle
- Make a payment that is returned unpaid
- Violate any other term of this Agreement

If you default, we may:
- Increase your APR to a penalty rate of up to 29.99%
- Reduce your credit limit
- Close your account
- Demand immediate payment of your entire balance

SECTION 6: CARDHOLDER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Your Rights:
- Zero liability for unauthorized transactions when reported promptly

Unauthorized Transactions: Report lost or stolen cards immediately by calling 1-800-ANTHOS1. You are not liable for unauthorized use after reporting.

General Disputes: Any disputes arising from this Agreement will be resolved through binding arbitration, except for disputes under $25,000 which may be resolved in small claims court.
